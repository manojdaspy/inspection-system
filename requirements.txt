# Manufacturing Inspection System Dependencies
# All dependencies use standard library - no external packages required

# Python 3.8+ standard library modules used:
# - threading (parallel execution)
# - concurrent.futures (ThreadPoolExecutor)
# - logging (structured logging)
# - time (timing and delays)
# - random (mock data generation)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - signal (graceful shutdown)
# - collections (defaultdict)
# - typing (type hints)

# No external dependencies required for mock implementation
